    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This is a continuation of my previous article <strong>DAX Chear sheet - Part 1</strong>.
        In this article, I have delved into the <strong>Time intelligence functions</strong> of DAX.
        Microsoft's documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/time-intelligence-functions-dax">here</a>.

    </p>

    <h1>Sample Data</h1>
    <p>
        I will be using the <strong>Adventure Works DW 2020</strong> sample model which can be downloaded <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/dax-sample-model">from Microsoft's site</a>.
        I have placed a copy of the PBIX in my Github repo, the link to which is at the end of this article.

    <h1>Custom date tables in Power BI</h1>
    <p>
        To understand the workings of the <strong>Date and Time intelligence</strong> DAX functions we will begin with creating a custom Date table.
        The AdventureWorks model also comes with a date table <strong>Date</strong>.
    </p>
    <h4>What is a Date table and why do we need one?</h4>
    <p>A date table is like any other table in Power BI but with some mandatory requirements as prescribed by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/model-date-tables">Power BI here</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It must have a column of data type date (or date/time) - known as the date column.</li>
        <li>The date column must contain unique values.</li>
        <li>The date column must not contain BLANKs.</li>
        <li>The date column must not have any missing dates.</li>
        <li>The date column must span full years. A year isn't necessarily a calendar year (January-December).</li>
        <li>The date table must be marked as a date table.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to create a  date table using DAX?</h4>
    <p>
        There are two Power BI functions which are useful for creating date tables.
        These  are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/calendar-function-dax">CALENDAR</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/calendarauto-function-dax">CALENDARAUTO</a>
        I have taken inspiration from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-li7sxUxEqA&amp;t=317s">wonderful tutorial</a>
        to create a custom date table and named it as <strong>MyCalendar</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>
MyCalendar = 

VAR myExtendedCalendar = ADDCOLUMNS(
            CALENDAR(DATE(2017,7,1),DATE(2021,6,30)), 
            "Year", YEAR([Date]),
            "MonthNumber", MONTH([Date]),
            "DayNumber", DAY([Date]),
            "Month", FORMAT([Date],"mmmm"),
            "DayOfWeek", FORMAT([Date],"ddd"),
            "DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY([Date]),
            "QuarterNumber", QUARTER([Date]),
            "Quarter", FORMAT([Date],"\QQ"),
            "WeekNumber",WEEKNUM([Date])
            )
//Add the Financial year columns        
VAR myExtendedCalendarWithFinancialColuns = ADDCOLUMNS(
            myExtendedCalendar, 
            "FinancialYear",IF( [MonthNumber]>=7, [Year]+1, [Year] ),
            "FinancialQuarterNumber",IF( [MonthNumber]>=7, [QuarterNumber]-2, [QuarterNumber]+2 )
            )
//Add the Financial Quarter columns            
VAR myExtendedCalenderWithQuarterDisplayColumn = ADDCOLUMNS(
            myExtendedCalendarWithFinancialColuns, 
            "FinancialQuarter",CONCATENATE("Q",[FinancialQuarterNumber])
            )

return myExtendedCalenderWithQuarterDisplayColumn    </pre>
    <h4>Structure of MyCalendar table</h4>
    <img src="images/MyCalendar-model.png" alt="MyCalendar" />
    <br />
    <img src="images/MyCalendar-dataview.png" alt="MyCalendar" />

    <h4>Setting the sort properties for the Text columns</h4>
    <p>
        We are nearly there. But, there is one essential step to be carried out.
        The textual columns like Month, DayOfWeek and Quarter need to be aware of the sort order.
        Consider the Month column. When this column is selected as the Columns in a Matrix visual, the sort order by default would be alphabetical, i.e. Dec comes before January. This is not right.
        We want the order Jan, Feb, March, April ,.. Dec. To achieve this we need to specify MonthNumber as the sort column for the Month column
    </p>

    <h1>Count the number of Sundays in any time period(FIRSTDATE, LASTDATE,DATESBETWEEN)</h1>
    <p>
        Given any slice of time, how do we find the number of Sundays in that period? In the following examples, a Matrix visual has been used with
        the Rows divided into hierarhical time periods
    </p>
    <h4>Matrix visual</h4>
    <img src="images/CountSundaysYearMonth.png" alt="Count sundays in year/month" />
    <img src="images/CountSundaysYearQuarter.png" alt="Count sundays in year/quarter" />
    <h4>DAX measure</h4>
    <pre>
NumberOfSundays = 
VAR first = FIRSTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])
VAR last = LASTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])
VAR daysInBetween = DATESBETWEEN(MyCalendar[Date] , first, last)
VAR datesWithSundays=FILTER(daysInBetween, WEEKDAY(MyCalendar[Date])==1) 
VAR countOfSundays = COUNTROWS(datesWithSundays)
return countOfSundays
    </pre>
    <p>
        For both the examples presented above we have used the single measure <code>NumberOfSundays</code>.
        The measure is agnostic of the length of the time period.
        The ROW filter in each of the visuals has all the information about the rows from the <code>MyCalendar[Date]</code> table.
        We use the expression <code>FIRSTDATE</code> and <code>LASTDATE</code> to find the bounds of the time period in each cell.
        The <code>DATESBETWEEN</code> expression gives us a table of all <code>MyCalendar</code> within these bounds.
        The count of Sundays is extracted by using the <code>FILTER</code> expression.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h1>Count the number of Friday 13th occurrences in any time period(FIRSTDATE, LASTDATE,DATESBETWEEN)</h1>
    <p>In this example, we count the occurences of all days which are Friday and are the 13 th day of the month. 
    The DAX measure is semantically identical to the one we wrote for counting the Sundays in any time period </p>
    <h4>Matrix visual</h4>
    <img src="images/CountFriday13th.PNG" alt="Friday the 13 th" />
    <h4>DAX measure</h4>
    <pre>
NumberOfFriday13th = 
VAR first = FIRSTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])
VAR last = LASTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])
VAR between = DATESBETWEEN(MyCalendar[Date],first, last)
VAR days = COUNTROWS
    (
        FILTER(
            between, 
            WEEKDAY(MyCalendar[Date])==6 && DAY(MyCalendar[Date])==13
            ) 
    )
return days
    </pre>

    <h4>Using a Slicer to select the time period</h4>
    <p>
        The same DAX measure can now be used to display the count of "Friday the 13th" for any arbitarily selected time period
    </p>
    <img src="images/CountFriday13th_Slicer.PNG"/>
    <hr />

    <h1>Total sales in any period (FIRSTDATE, LASTDATE,RELATED, FILTER)</h1>
    <p>We will achieve this using 3 different approaches</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Out of box drag n drop(no measure)</li>
        <li>A measure which queries using the Adventure Works Date table</li>
        <li>A measure which queries using the custom MyCalendar table</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="images/TotalSales-3-approaches.PNG" alt="Total sales"/>
    <h4>Option-1 Out of box drag n drop(no measure)</h4>
    <p>This being a fairly simple calculation, we can drag and drop the <strong>Sales Amount</strong> column of the <strong>Total Sales</strong></p>
    and then selecting the <strong>Sum</strong> option from the context menu

    <h4>Option-2 A measure which queries using the Adventure Works Date table </h4>
    <p>The <strong>FIRSTDATE</strong> and <strong>LASTDATE</strong> expressions on the <strong>out of box Date table</strong> 
        gives us the bounds of the time period in the current context. The <strong>DATESBETWEEN</strong> gives us all the dates from the date table and we use this to provide a filter in the <strong>CALCULATE</strong> expression</p>
    <pre>
    TotalSalesInPeriodUsingAdWorksDate = 
    
    var first = FIRSTDATE('Date'[Date])
    var last =  LASTDATE('Date'[Date])

    VAR between = DATESBETWEEN('Date'[Date], first , last)
    VAR filteredDates = FILTER('Date', 'Date'[Date] in between)
    VAR totalSales  = CALCULATE
    ( 
        SUMX(Sales, Sales[Sales Amount]),
        filteredDates
    )
    return totalSales

    </pre>

    <h4>Option-3 A measure which queries using the custom MyCalendar table</h4>
    <p>The Matrix visual is using the <strong>MyCalendar date </strong> table to render the hierarchy. 
    Therefore, in this measure we use the <strong>FIRSTDATE</strong> and <strong>LASTDATE</strong> to get the bounds. 
    The <strong>CALCULATE</strong> expression is modifying its context by filtering on the 
        <strong>Adventure Works date table</strong></p>
    <pre>
    TotalSalesInPeriodUsingMyCalendar = 
    
    var first = FIRSTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])
    var last =  LASTDATE(MyCalendar[Date])

    /*
    In this measure, we are assuming that there is no direct relationship between MyCalendar and Sales
    Hence the need for explicit filtering
    */
    VAR totalSales  = CALCULATE
    ( 
        SUMX(Sales, Sales[Sales Amount]),
        FILTER(
            Sales,
            RELATED('Date'[Date]) >= first && RELATED('Date'[Date]) <= last
            )
    )
    return totalSales

    </pre>

    <h1>Cumulative sales in a month (DATESMTD, CALCULATE, FILTER, SUMX)</h1>
    <p>The DAX expression <strong>DATESMTD</strong> will produce a new table with all dates from the start of the month upto the current day of the context.
    How is this useful? You can produce a report of running totals (month to date) for any given month. We will proceed cautiously here. 
        Before we jump to calculating the sales we will attempt to get the cumulative dates for any given day in a month. 
        Once this is obtained it is fairly easy to do the next step , i.e. calculate the cumulative sales.
    </p>
    <h4>DAX expression to produce a count of days in current month to date</h4>
    <p>Using the following DAX measure, we display the running total of days from start to current date. E.g. On 4 th February the cumulative count would be 4 (1st Feb, 2nd, 3rd, 4th). 
    Likewise for 5th February, the total would be 5. <strong>Why do we need the running total of the days? </strong>This will be useful in the next step.       
    </p>
    <pre>
DatesMtdDemo1 = 
VAR datesInThisMonth = DATESMTD(MyCalendar[Date])
return COUNTROWS(datesInThisMonth)
    </pre>
    <img src="images/DatesMtd-CumulativeDaysInMonth.png" alt="DATESMTD"/>

    <h4>Cumulative sales in a month - the hard way</h4>
    <p>In the previou step we obtained the cumulative count of days in a month. We will use this informatin to FILTER the Sales. In the following DAX measure we use the <strong>DATESMTD</strong> to get all the date values from the start of month till current day in the month.
    The <strong>Date[Date]</strong> column is filtered using the cumulative list of days.
    The cumulative value of <strong>Sales[Sales Amount]</strong> is then calculated by using the list of days.
    </p>
    <pre>
    DatesMtdDemo2 = 
        VAR datesInThisMonth = DATESMTD(MyCalendar[Date])
        VAR filteredDates = FILTER('Date', 'Date'[Date] in datesInThisMonth)
        VAR totalSales  = CALCULATE
        ( 
            SUMX(Sales, Sales[Sales Amount]),
            filteredDates
        )
        return totalSales
    </pre>
    <p>In the following illustration we do a side by side comparison of the cumulative sales on the last day of the month on the left side and the total sales in that month on the right. Notice that the cumulative total on <strong>Feb 28 th</strong> (left side) is equal to the overall monthly total on <strong>Feb</strong> (right side).
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h1>Cumulative sales in a month - the easier way (TOTALMTD)</h1>
    <p>The following DAX measure expects a current day of month in the current context. </p>
    <pre>
    TotalMonthToDate = TOTALMTD(SUMX(Sales, [Sales Amount]),'Date'[Date])
    </pre>
    How can we be sure that <strong>TOTALMTD</strong> produces the same value as that obtained by the customer measure <strong>DatesMtdDemo2</strong> that we wrote in the previous section?
    Let us do a side by side comparison
    <br />
