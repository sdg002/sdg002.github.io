# Objective 
## First objective
Given any continuous set of points in a field of noisy points, can we eliminate the noisy points and determine the curve

## Second objective
Give 2 or more continous curves in a field of noisy points, can we not only eliminate the noisy points but also identify the 2 continuous curves

# What are the curves?
## Circle
## Parabola
## Cubic
## Sine
