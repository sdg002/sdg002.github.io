# Objective 
## First objective
Given any continuous set of points in a field of noisy points, can we eliminate the noisy points and determine the curve

## Second objective
Give 2 or more continous curves in a field of noisy points, can we not only eliminate the noisy points but also identify the 2 continuous curves

# What are the curves?
## Circle
## Parabola
## Cubic
## Sine

# How to set PYTHONPATH?
From inside VSCODE, you can do the following to both the Python Debug Console and Python Console
```
$env:PYTHONPATH="%USERPROFILE%\MyTrials\MyGithubPage\simple-geometry"
```

# Installing via Anaconda
Summarizing my failed attempt to using Conda
## What did I install?
Installed miniconda because it has a smaller disk foot print

## How to install a package using Anaconda?
- Start menu
- Launch Anaconda (Miniconda) prompt
- `conda install scikit-geometry -c conda-forge`
- `conda list` should show your package
## Where does Anaconda install the packages?
%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3
