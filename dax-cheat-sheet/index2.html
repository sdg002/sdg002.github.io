            DAX Cheat sheet - Part 2
        </h1>
    </header>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This is a continuation of my previous article <strong>DAX Chear sheet - Part 1</strong>.
        In this article, I have continue to expand the scenarios using the same MS Access database from MS learing
        that I used in the first part
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h1>Sample data</h1>
    <p>
        The DAX expressions in this article are written around the
        MS Access sample database downloadable from <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Analyzing-Visualizing-Data-PowerBI">Microsoft Learning</a>.
        A copy of the same can also be downloaded from my Github repo <a href="https://sdg002.github.io/dax-cheat-sheet/data/MS-learning-msaccessdb.zip">here</a>.
        A copy of the Power BI report which references this MS Access database can be downloaded from my Github repo <a href="https://sdg002.github.io/dax-cheat-sheet/DAXCheatSheet.pbix">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>Database schema</h1>

    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p>To get a feel of what the data looks like I have presented the top 5 rows from each of the tables in this database</p>

    <h1>Primer on DAX studio and writing DAX expressions</h1>
    <p>
        I have a very brief intro to getting started with DAX Studion in the <strong>Part 1</strong> of this series.

        In the interest of brevity, I will skip the details.
    </p>

    <h1>I want a table of Manufacturers along the rows and revenues for every Segment along the columns (Visual approach, no DAX)</h1>
    <img src="images-part2/manuf-segment-no-dax.png" />
    <p>
        In this approach, we use a Matrix visual. There is no need for any custom DAX. Power BI will harness the relationships 
        and throw the data into the appropriate cells of the matrix.         
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The <strong>Segment</strong> column of <strong>bi_product</strong> goes into the <strong>Columns</strong> of the Matrix
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Manufacturer</strong> column of the <strong>bi_manufacturer</strong> table into the <strong>Rows</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            We summarize by the Sum measure on the <strong>Revenue</strong> column of <strong>bi_sales</strong> table
        </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
        This is fairly simple and gets you started very quickly. But, I find that there are some serious limitations. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Matrix visual does not let me sort the rows by clicking on the column header. This is a known limitation as of 
        </li>
        <li>
            I cannot control the order in which the Segments are listed. Power BI will arrange them in alphabetical order
        </li>
        <li>
            If a manufacture has not registered any sale for a specific segment then Power BI shows a blank cell. 
            A zero would convey more meaning.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>I want a table of Manufacturers along the rows and revenues for every Segment along the columns (Visual approach, with DAX measure to return 0)</h1>
    <p>In this approach we create a measure on the <code>bi_manufacture</code> table with the name <code>RevenuePerSegment</code></p>
    <pre>
RevenuePerSegment = 
VAR totalRevenue=SUM(bi_salesFact[Revenue])
VAR retval=CALCULATE( IF(ISBLANK(totalRevenue),0,totalRevenue)  )
return retval
    </pre>

    <h1>I want a table of Manufacturers along the rows and revenues for every Segment along the columns (Segments in a slicer)</h1>
    <p>you were here - use PIVOT</p>
    <pre> code snippet comes here</pre>

    <hr style="height:1em;" />
    <h2>My ideas 1</h2>
    <p>

        PIVOT table<br />
        Monthly/Quarterly break down of sales across all years<br />
        Show the significance of ALL , by showing a table of Manuf-%sales of Combined sales. Have a slicer of Manuf
        Show the significance of ALL , by showing a table of Manuf-Segment-Sales. Have a slicer of Segment. Add a column to show % of total sales

    </p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Ideas 1</h1>
    <h4>How to PIVOT - manufacturer and segments</h4>
    <p>Simple scenario. Manuf along vertical direction. Segments along Horizontal direction. Use a Table visual for sorting - not matrix</p>
    <h4>Show the unit sales of Segment1 and Segment2 for every manufacture</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>This could be done using a hard coded measure approach. 1 measure per segment</li>
        <li>
            Have a list of Segments. Have a measure on Manufacturer. A slicer which shows the list of segments. A matrix table and custom measure based on Age bands demo.
            The Rows of the matrix could be Country-City hierarchy or any hierarchy
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Year wise break down for every manufacturer</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Follow same approach as above, But, this could be done via Histogram or Matrix visual
        </li>
        <li>
            Years along X axis along with slicer
        </li>
        <li>
            Manuf could be along rows of a Matrix visual
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Monthly sales per manufacturer - plotted on a histogram</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Year-month along X -axis</li>
        <li>Multi-column stacked chart. 1 per manuf</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>Fraction of total sale per Segment for every Manufacture</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a measure to compute the value</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the significance of ALL</li>
        <li>AllEXCEPT could also be used</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Sentiment - Product segment with best and worst segment per manufacturer</h4>
    <p>Think.....</p>
    <h4>Top 3 cities with Revenue for every manufacture. </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Manuf along Rows</li>
        <li>First Best City, Second Best City , Third Best City as column titles</li>
        <li>Top most revenue, next highest revenue , third highest revenue along cell values</li>
        <li>Could be done by created a parameters table BestCitiesForRevenu. A measure attached to this table</li>
    </ol>

        A similar coverage of time intelligence functions will be helpful. An explanation of evaluation contexts and context transition will also help
