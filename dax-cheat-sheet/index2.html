    <h2>My ideas 1</h2>
    <p>

        PIVOT table<br />
        Monthly/Quarterly break down of sales across all years<br />
        Show the significance of ALL , by showing a table of Manuf-%sales of Combined sales. Have a slicer of Manuf
        Show the significance of ALL , by showing a table of Manuf-Segment-Sales. Have a slicer of Segment. Add a column to show % of total sales

    </p>

    <h1>Ideas 1</h1>
    <h4>How to PIVOT - manufacturer and segments</h4>
    <p>Simple scenario. Manuf along vertical direction. Segments along Horizontal direction. Use a Table visual for sorting - not matrix</p>
    <h4>Show the unit sales of Segment1 and Segment2 for every manufacture</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>This could be done using a hard coded measure approach. 1 measure per segment</li>
        <li>Have a list of Segments. Have a measure on Manufacturer. A slicer which shows the list of segments. A matrix table and custom measure based on Age bands demo.
        The Rows of the matrix could be Country-City hierarchy or any hierarchy</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Year wise break down for every manufacturer</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Follow same approach as above, But, this could be done via Histogram or Matrix visual
        </li>
        <li>
            Years along X axis along with slicer
        </li>
        <li>
            Manuf could be along rows of a Matrix visual
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Monthly sales per manufacturer - plotted on a histogram</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Year-month along X -axis</li>
        <li>Multi-column stacked chart. 1 per manuf</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <h4>Fraction of total sale per Segment for every Manufacture</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a measure to compute the value</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the significance of ALL</li>
        <li>AllEXCEPT could also be used</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Sentiment - Product segment with best and worst segment per manufacturer</h4>
    <p>Think.....</p>
    <h4>Top 3 cities with Revenue for every manufacture. </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Manuf along Rows</li>
        <li>First Best City, Second Best City , Third Best City as column titles</li>
        <li>Top most revenue, next highest revenue , third highest revenue along cell values</li>
        <li>Could be done by created a parameters table BestCitiesForRevenu. A measure attached to this table</li>
    </ol>

        A similar coverage of time intelligence functions will be helpful. An explanation of evaluation contexts and context transition will also help
