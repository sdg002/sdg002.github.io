## AverageDistanceBetween2Points.py
Demonstrates a Monte Carlo approach to detemine the average distance between 2 randomly picked points in an unit square. This is a classical problem which has an elegant theoretical solution - but a very difficult one. The source code presents a very approach.

## AverageNND.py 
In this file we fill a square with progressively increasing number of random points and for every distribution we calculate the mean distance
