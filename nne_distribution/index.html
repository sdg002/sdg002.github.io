            Surprising behaviour of the average nearest neighbour distance in a cluster of points
        </h1>

    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was staring at images which were dotted with various densities of salt and pepper noise. Some natural questions popped up in my mind - what happens to the distance between the points when they
        get more and more crowded? If we were to define a metric to measure the proximity between points, say <em>average nearest neighbour</em> , 
        then how does this metric behave with increasing density of points?
        <br />
        <img src="images/NoisyImage-0.600.png" />
        <br />
        <em>Image with salt pepper ratio=0.6</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/NoisyImage-0.900.png" />
        <br />
        <em>Image with salt pepper ratio=0.90</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/NoisyImage-0.990.png" />
        <br />
        <em>Image with salt pepper ratio=0.99</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        The salt and pepper ratio is defined as the probability of a randomly selected pixel being white (salt) in colour. Higher the value, lesser is the number of black pixels
        and hence the points appear to be further apart. Salt and pepper noise can be applied only any image, i.e. color or gray scale. 
        We will restrict our examples to monochrome images only. A pixel can be white or black only.

        Understanding Nearest Neighbour Distance
    </h2>
    <p>
        Consider the points displayed in this image. By definition, every point has 1 one point which is closest. 
        You could have multiple points which are equidistant and hence multiple nearest neighbours. But for this discussion we will pick the closest neighbour.

    <h2>
        Why does the average neighbour distance exhibit such a distribution?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We can see that at N=2, the average is .5BLAH. With increasing N, the average distance falls very rapidly and then flattens out.

        Finding a mathematical model
    </h2>
    <p>
        We will make some approximations. Consider a square with N=4 points, N=9 points and N=16 points

        Looking at the above, we can come up with the following approximation:

        Write down the derivative
        Conclude that with increasing N the slope becomes 0 and thus the curve flattens out.
