            Surprising behaviour of the average nearest neighbour distance in a cluster of points

    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        What gave you this idea? You were observing images with salt and pepper noise, with increasing percentage of noise.
        The question I asked myself - what happens to the nearest neighbour distance.

        Explain in 1 line about NNE.

    <h2>
        Images with salt and pepper noise
    </h2>
    <p>
        Explain salt and pepper. Show some sample pics
    </p>
    <img src="images/NoisyImage-0.600.png" />
    <img src="images/NoisyImage-0.990.png" />
    <p>Display the SP ratios of all the images</p>

    <h2>
        Begin with just 2 points in an unit square
    </h2>
    <p>
        Talk about the problem of the expected distance between 2 randomly selected points in a square
