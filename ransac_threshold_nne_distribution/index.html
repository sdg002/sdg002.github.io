        Caveat that this is not a detailed discussion on RANSAC.
        Provide link to original RANSAC (https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/outlier-detection-using-the-ransac-algorithm-de52670adb4a)

        Show picture 2 with the line that would have been calculated by the least squares method
        <br />
        Show picture 3 with the line that is calculated by RANSAC

        Intuition behind using the mean Nearest Neighbour Distance
    </h2>
    <p>
        What was the inspirtion for using NNE distance?
        <br />
        We will use various values of threshold and apply RANSAC on images with varying noise density
