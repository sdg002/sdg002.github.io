    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        The RANSAC algorithm is a very robust and a well established approach to determinine the straight line(s) which fit a noisy set of data points. 
        In this article I have explored the possiblity of using the Nearest Neighbour Distance statistic 
        as a means of arriving at the RANSAC threshold distance parameter
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        What problem does the RANSAC algorithm solve?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Consider the data points below.
        We have a mix of inliers (black) and outliers (red). We want to find the model of the straight line which fits the inliers. 
        The human mind can easily distinguish the inliers from the outliers and produce a line which neatly fits all the inliers.
        <br />
        <img src="images/all_data_points.png" alt="All data points" />
        <br />
        RANSAC is a simple voting-based algorithm that iteratively samples the population of points and find the subset of those lines which appear to conform to a model. In this case, the model is a straight line.
        <img src="images/desired_line_mind.png" alt="All data points" />
        <br />
        Least squares method will encompass all points thereby producing a line which is away from the desired line

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the <strong>threshold</strong> is too large then the RANSAC algorithm will produce a line which has encompassed potential outliers. 
        </li>

        <li>
            If the <strong>threshold</strong> is too small then the RANSAC algorithm might not find anything at all.

    <h2>
        What is the the intuition behind Nearest Neighbour Distance?
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>What is Nearest Neighbour Distance (NNE)?</strong><br />
        Consider the points displayed in this image. By definition, every point has 1 one point which is closest. You could have multiple points which are equidistant and hence multiple nearest neighbours. But for this discussion we will pick the closest neighbour.
        <br />
        <img src="images/nne_introduction.png" alt="NNE introduction"/>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Point 2 is the nearest neighbour of point 1
        </li>
        <li>
            Point 2 is the nearest neighbour of point 4 and vice-versa
        </li>
        <li>
            Point 4 is the nearest neighbour of point 3
        </li>
        <li>
            Point 4 is the nearest neighbour of point 5
        </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="images/definition_average_nne.png" alt="Definition of average NNE"/>
    <p>
        <br />
        <strong>What was the inspiration for using NNE distance?</strong>
        <br />
        The NNE statistic gives us an idea of how close or spread out the data points are.
        The RANSAC threshold distance parameter must have some correlation with the mean or median NNE.

    <h2>Going deeper into the implementation</h2>
    <h4>Step 1 - Generate noisy images with various salt pepper ratios</h4>
    <p>
    To determine the robustness of an algorithm it is vital that we test our code against various degrees of salt and pepper noise. 
    For this article, I have selected the salt-pepper ratios 0.90, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97 and 0.99.
    </p>
    <img src="images/examples_of_salt_pepper_ratios.png" alt="Examples of salt pepper ratios"/>
    <p>
    Every image will have a dotted line.
    This dotted line will be the target that we expect the RANSAC algorithm to discover.
    To further increase the complexity of the challenge we will test lines drawn with various degrees of sparseness.
    The further apart the points, the more sparse the line and greater the challenge.
    For this article, I have selected the values 2,5,7 and 10
    </p>
    <img src="images/examples_of_max_distance_between_points.png" alt="Examples of max distance"/><br />
    The file <strong>SaltPepperNoise.py</strong> is responsible for generating the noisy images.
    <h4>Step 2 - Running the RANSAC algorithm</h4>
    <p>The file <strong>ExecuteRansac.py</strong> is responsible for crunching the input images produced in the previous step.
    In this step we use the <strong>median Nearest Neighbour distance</strong> to arrive at the RANSAC threshold. 
    For every input image we will experiment with different RANSAC threshold parameters. The RANSAC threshold parameter is arrived at by 
    multiplying a <strong>threshold factor</strong> with the <strong>median Nearest Neighbour distance</strong>. 
    The RANSAC line is superimposed over the original image.<br />
    </p>
    <img src="images/overview_noisy_pic_result_pic.png" alt="Noisy image to image with RANSAC line superimposed"/>
    <h4>Step 3 - Displaying the results</h4>
    <p>Finally, we want to render the overall results in a manner which lets us arrive at meaningful conclusions. 
    The script  <strong>PlotResultsSideBySide.py</strong> will crunch the input images and result 
    images produced by the above steps into a single HTML file. Example below:
