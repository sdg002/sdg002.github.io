        What problem does the RANSAC algorithm solve?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Consider the data points below.
        We have a mix of inliers (black) and outliers (red). We want to find the model of the straight line which fits the inliers. 
        The human mind can easily distinguish the inliers from the outliers and produce a line which neatly fits all the inliers.

        <br />
        RANSAC is a simple voting-based algorithm that iteratively samples the population of points and find the subset of those lines which appear to conform to a model. In this case, the model is a straight line.

        <br />
        Least squares method will encompass all points thereby producing a line which is away from the desired line

        <li>Find the line using Least Squares which fits the N points</li>
        <li>Find all points which are inliers to this new line. Inliers are points which are within threshold distance 'd' of the line</li>
