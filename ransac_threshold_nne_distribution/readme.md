# Overview
This is the companion source code to my article on Medium titled [Nearest neighbour distance metric approach to determine the RANSAC threshold](https://medium.com/@saurabh.dasgupta1/nearest-neighbour-distance-metric-approach-to-determine-the-ransac-threshold-f0213562a196)  
In this article I have explored the possiblity of using the median Nearest Neighbour Distance as a means of arriving at the RANSAC threshold distance parameter
