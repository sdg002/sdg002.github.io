        In this article we will do a walk through of how to use Redis Cache from a .NET Core Serverless HTTP function.
        Redis is a very powerful caching engine and offers features beyond simple key-value pair caching. In this article, I will restrict my focus to the following topics:
        <ol>
            <li>Installing Redis locally and on Azure</li>
            <li>Using the command line tools of Redis</li>
            <li>Scripting the installation of Azure Redis via PowerShell and ARM templates</li>
            <li>Writing some sample C# code to demonstrate the key-value pair caching aspect of Redis using a sample Azure HTTP trigger function</li>
            <li>Benchmarking the latency and throughput of Redis using simple C# client code</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
